# RAG Indexing Spinner Debug Guide

## Problem Description

The RAG indexing spinner never stops when the index button is clicked, indicating the indexing process is hanging or failing silently.

## Debugging Steps

### 1. **Check Browser Console (Most Important)**

1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Click the RAG index button
4. Look for error messages or logs
5. The enhanced logging should show exactly where the process stops

### 2. **Test Gemini API**

1. Visit `/debug` page in your browser
2. Click "Test Connection" to verify API connectivity
3. Click "Test API" with a custom prompt
4. Check if both tests pass

### 3. **Run Debug Script**

```bash
node debug-rag.js
```

This will test the RAG service components directly without the UI.

### 4. **Check Environment Variables**

Ensure you have a `.env.local` file with:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

### 5. **Monitor Network Requests**

1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Click the RAG index button
4. Look for failed API calls or timeouts

### 6. **Check Server Logs**

Look at your terminal/console where Next.js is running for server-side errors.

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Missing API Key

**Symptoms:** API calls fail with authentication errors
**Solution:** Set `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env.local`

### Issue 2: API Rate Limiting

**Symptoms:** API calls succeed but take a very long time
**Solution:** Check Gemini API quotas and add delays between calls

### Issue 3: Large File Processing

**Symptoms:** Process hangs on large files
**Solution:** Check file size limits (currently 500KB per file, 10MB total)

### Issue 4: Memory Issues

**Symptoms:** Process hangs due to memory exhaustion
**Solution:** The system has built-in memory management, but check browser memory usage

### Issue 5: Network Timeout

**Symptoms:** API calls timeout
**Solution:** Check internet connection and API endpoint accessibility

## Enhanced Logging Features

The updated code now includes:

- Progress tracking every 5 seconds
- 2-minute timeout protection
- Detailed logging at each step
- Memory usage monitoring
- Batch processing status

## Debug Endpoints

- `/debug` - Interactive debugging page
- `/api/gemini` - Test Gemini API directly
- `GET /api/gemini` - Test API connection
- `POST /api/gemini` - Test API with custom prompt

## Expected Console Output

When indexing works correctly, you should see:

```
🚀 Starting Google RAG indexing process...
📁 Files to be indexed: [...]
🔍 Calling ragService.indexFiles()...
🚀 Starting Google RAG indexing process...
📁 Calling fileManager.indexFiles()...
🚀 Starting RAG indexing process...

📦 Processing batch 1/X

🔍 Generating embeddings for X chunks...
📝 Processing embedding batch 1/X
✅ Generated X embeddings
🎉 Google RAG indexing completed in XXXms!
✅ Google RAG indexing completed successfully!
🏁 Indexing process finished (finally block executed)
```

## If Still Having Issues

1. **Check the exact point where logging stops** - this indicates where the process hangs
2. **Verify API key is valid** - test with a simple curl request
3. **Check file content** - ensure files don't contain problematic characters
4. **Monitor memory usage** - the system has built-in memory limits
5. **Try with a single small file** - to isolate the issue

## Support

If the issue persists after following these steps:

1. Copy the complete console output
2. Note the exact point where logging stops
3. Check if any error messages appear
4. Verify the API key works with other tools
