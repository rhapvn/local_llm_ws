PDF Testing Information

To test the PDF functionality in the RAG system:

1. Create a simple PDF file with text content
2. Upload it to the sidebar
3. The system will automatically extract text and index it
4. You can then ask questions about the PDF content

Expected PDF Features:
- Text extraction from all pages
- Page count display
- Error handling for invalid PDFs
- File size validation (10MB limit)
- Automatic text chunking and indexing

PDF Processing Notes:
- Complex layouts may not preserve formatting perfectly
- Tables and images are not currently supported
- Text extraction works best with simple text-based PDFs
- Processing time depends on PDF size and complexity

Test PDF Creation:
You can create a test PDF using:
- Microsoft Word (Save as PDF)
- Google Docs (Download as PDF)
- Online PDF converters
- Any text editor that supports PDF export

The system will show:
- File icon (PDF vs TXT)
- Page count for PDFs
- Character count after text extraction
